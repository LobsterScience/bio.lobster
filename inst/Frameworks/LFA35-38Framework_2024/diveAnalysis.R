###Dive Analysis


## determine the Number of lobster by 100m2 for each year within each area
##determine areas.. site groupings.. or maybe just by LFA
##Calculate the total area sampled for each transect
##Calculate the number of lobster per transect by area

## how to roll up the sites by groupings so its right... or not skewed.. 

##Roll up info by LFA... include unique sites, year range, total transects in that information?


##length Freqs for each data source.. 
## shift in size ranges for sites with longer time series ( just GRAND MANAN? or maybe maces bay)



### Import data with filled out substrates from summary script
## calculate the % of each substrate type at the level ? sections? that the old data does.

##determine dominate substrate by section and figure out how lobster are associated with it via glmm?
