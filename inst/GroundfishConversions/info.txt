# lenseq is the length bin: you can set a cut-off length range to apply flat conversion outside, recommended range based on proportion of data is 39-173mm, historical max-min length range in RV surveys is 4-220mm
# est_tho is the estimated conversion (ratio between cartier/cabot and teleost)
# est_log_rho is the estimated log conversion for each length bin
# estimated std of log_rho, sd_log_rho, can be used to calculate CIs
