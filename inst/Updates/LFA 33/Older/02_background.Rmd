# Background

## Description of the fishery

The commercial fishery for American Lobster has been active for over 100 years in LFA 33. This
area covers 25,722 km2 from Halifax to Shelburne County. Though the LFA extends out to
92 km (50 nautical miles), the fishery is primarily prosecuted within 15 km (100 m depth contour)
on the eastern end and more recently in offshore areas on the western end (Figure 1). The
fishery is effort controlled, with restrictions on the number of licences, number of traps per
licence (250), season length, Minimum Legal Size (MLS), and retention of berried females
(Cook et al. 2020, DFO 2019b). The fishing season begins on the last Monday in November and
goes until May 31. The landings in LFA 33 for the 2018-19 fishing season were xx mt
(Table 1).
