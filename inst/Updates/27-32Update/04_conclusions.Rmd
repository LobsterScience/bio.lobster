# Conclusions

The primary indicator of stock status, CPUE, shows a positive signal for all LFAs. CPUE remains at very high levels at or near the highest value in the time series of for each LFA and remain well above the USR and LRP. Landings, though not yet complete remain high in all LFAs for their respective time series with effort staying relatively consistent. For the LFAs where bycatch was estimated, 2019 shows a decrease for all species recorded.
