The scientific basis for assessing Lobster Fishing Areas (LFAs) 27-33 was examined at a framework meeting in January 2018, followed by an assessment of the status of the lobster resources in LFAs 27-32 in February 2019. This update applies a suite of indicators from the 2018 framework to the stock status up to the end of the 2019 season wherever possible. Primary stock status indicators for lobster in LFAs 27-32 meet the intent of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) precautionary approach and allow for the evaluation of stock status. This Science Response Report results from the Science Response Process of February 11th 2020, on the 2019 LFA 27-32 Lobster Stock Status Update.
