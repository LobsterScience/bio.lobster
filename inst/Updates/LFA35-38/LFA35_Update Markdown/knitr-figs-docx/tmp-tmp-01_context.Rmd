#Context

The scientific basis for assessing the status of American Lobster (Homarus americanus) in
Lobster Fishing Area (LFA) 35 was examined at an assessment framework review meeting in
September 2019, followed by an assessment of the status of the Lobster resources in LFA 35 in
October 2019 (DFO 2021a), a Stock Status Update in August 2020 (DFO 2021b), and again in September 2021 (DFO 2022). One
primary indicator and three secondary indicators that describe changes in Lobster abundance
and biomass were defined, and reference points for the primary indicator were proposed. A
suite of indicators is applied in this update from the 2019 framework review to update the stock
status to the end of the 2020â€“2021 fishing season, wherever possible.
 
This Science Response Report results from the Regional Science Response Process of
September ##, 2022 on the Stock Status Update of American Lobster in Lobster Fishing Area
(LFA) 35.
