# Conclusions

Since 2011, LFA 35 has been in a high-productivity period and, as of 2020, the primary indicator of stock status, CPUE, shows a positive signal for LFA 35 and remains well above the USR. Given the reporting rate for landings is currently between 36% and 86% by month, annual landings appear to be on track. As of 2020, there has been an increase in total, commercial, and recruit abundance. Between 2018 and 2019, however, a large decline was evident in both commercial biomass and recruit abundance. In 2020, these values were marginally higher than 2019, but they are well below the highs observed between 2012 and 2018. Across most of the indicators (CPUE, commercial biomass, and recruit abundance), the productivity of the last two years was low compared to 2012â€“2018. The LFA 35 Lobster stock continues to be in a productive period and is currently in the Healthy Zone.
