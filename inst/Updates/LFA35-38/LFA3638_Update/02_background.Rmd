# Background

## Description of the fishery

Commercial Lobster fishing in LFAs 36 and 38 occurs in the Bay of Fundy (Figure 1), with active
fisheries for over 150 years. These two LFAs border either one (LFA 36) or both (LFA 38) of the
two biggest Lobster fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic: LFA 34, with the highest Lobster
landings in Canada; and Downeast Maine, with the highest landings in the United States of
America (USA). Access to LFA 37 is provided to both LFA 36 and 38 licence holders by way of
licence conditions. Landings from LFA 37 are attributed to the respective LFAs stated on the
licence. A long-term increase in landings in LFAs 36 and 38 began in the mid-1990s, and
current landings are above the long-term average. A similar increase in landings was also
observed in most of the Gulf of Maine regions and other LFAs in Atlantic Canada.

The fishery is managed by input controls including a Minimum Legal Size (MLS, 82.5 mm
Carapace Length [CL]), prohibition on landing of both egg-bearing and v-notched (with no setal
hairs) females, limited entry licencing, trap limits, and season length. LFA 36 has a split fishing
season starting the second Tuesday in November to January 14th and from March 31st to June
29th, with a trap limit of 300 (per license), while LFA 38 occurs from the second Tuesday in November to
June 29th, with a trap limit of 375. Other management measures include the requirement of 
vents to allow sublegal-sized Lobster to escape and biodegradable trap mechanisms to mitigate
ghost fishing by lost traps.
