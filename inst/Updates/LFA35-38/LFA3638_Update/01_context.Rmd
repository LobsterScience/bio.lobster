The scientific basis for assessing the status of American Lobster (Homarus americanus) in Lobster Fishing Areas (LFAs) 36 and 38 were reviewed at an assessment framework review meeting in September 2019 (ref ), followed by an assessment of the status of the Lobster resources in LFAs 35-38 in October 2019 (DFO 2021a), followed by yearly updates (DFO ###,DFO####). One primary indicator and three secondary indicators that describe changes in Lobster abundance and biomass were defined, reference points for the primary indicator were also defined. A suite of indicators is applied in this update from the 2019 assessment framework to update the stock status to the end of the 2021â€“2022 fishing season, where data are available. 

This Science Response Report results from the Regional Science Response Process of September ##, 2022 on the Stock Status Update of Lobster in Lobster Fishing Areas (LFA) 36-38.
