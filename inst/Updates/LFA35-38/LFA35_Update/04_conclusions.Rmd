## Conclusions

Since 2011, LFA 35 has been in a high-productivity period and, as of August 2022, the primary indicator of stock status, CPUE, shows a positive signal for LFA 35 and remains well above the USR. Given the reporting rate for landings is currently between 44% to 88% by month, annual landings appear to be on track with recent years. 

This update did not include total, commercial and recruit abundance from the DFO RV survey due to incomplete surveys and unavailable data. The most up to date figures on commercial biomass, recruit abundance and relative fishing mortality can be found in the previous Science Response for LFA 35 (DFO 2022).

CPUE from the most recent 5 years shows a steady, high estimate of productivity, where recruit abundance from the scallop survey (2020 data not collected and 2022 not yet available) shows highly variable estimates of productivity. The LFA 35 Lobster stock continues to be in a productive period and is currently in the Healthy Zone.
