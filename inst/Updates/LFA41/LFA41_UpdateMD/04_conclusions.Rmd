# Conclusions

The primary indicators of stock status for Lobster in LFA 41 show the stock is in the Healthy Zone, with all four multispecies-survey-commercial-biomass indices above their respective USIs. Reproductive potential estimates were also above the upper boundaries where defined. Despite not having a removal reference or estimates of removal rates, the TAC of 720 t poses minimal risk to the stock status falling into the Cautious Zone, as the stock has proven its resilience to this level of removal.
