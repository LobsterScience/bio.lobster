# Context

The status of American Lobster (Homarus americanus) in Lobster Fishing Area (LFA) 41 was last assessed in the fall of 2017 (DFO 2018; Cook et al. 2017) with annual updates in the following years. This update applies the suite of indicators from the 2017 assessment to determine the stock status up to the end of the 2020 season. 

The Northeast Fisheries Science Centre (NEFSC) surveys were not conducted in 2020, and the at-sea observer companies were restricted, or limited, in their operations due to concerns with the COVID-19 global pandemic.

The survey data were updated where possible.
Indicators for Lobster in LFA 41 are consistent with the Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) precautionary approach and allow for the evaluation and monitoring of the offshore Lobster fishery. 

This Science Response Report results from the Science Response Process of October 22,2021, on the Stock Status Update of American Lobster in Lobster Fishing Area (LFA) 41.
